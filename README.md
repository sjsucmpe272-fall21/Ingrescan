### Ingredients Analyser Mobile App

### Problem Statement
To analyse and give detailed suggestions about the ingredients used in the product, based on the userâ€™s profile and health.

### Abstract
As per the Center for Disease Control and Prevention [2], [3] and [4] :-

   -  In the year 2018, around half a million deaths in the US included hypertension as a primary or contributing cause. 
   -  29 million adults in the US have cholesterol levels higher than 240 mg/dl. Which basically means he/she has a high probability of developing a heart disease.
   -  1 in 10 Americans have diabetes and 1 in 3 Americans have prediabetes.

Most of the causes for such life threatening diseases are caused by processed and ultra-processed foods. In [1] Baldridge et al, have stressed on the fact that more than 70% of the food products in the US are ultra processed. Ultra processed foods are those that typically have many ingredients including sugar, oils, fats, salt, stabilizers, and preservatives. Ultra-processed foods are unhealthy no matter where you look but compared to other countries, the US version is even worse, because it is generally processed with a higher sugar and sodium content, the study reports.

### Approach
The dataset would be hosted through a MongoDB database. The user would be able to scan any ingredient list and the app would basically give information about the pros and cons of each of the ingredients. Furthermore, based on the user profile, the application would rate the healthiness of the product.

### Persona
Our target audience would be individuals who do their grocery shopping. This tool will help the users to make an informed decision about their purchase.
